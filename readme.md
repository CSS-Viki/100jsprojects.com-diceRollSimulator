# Project description

Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulator project. The final version of the project features a dice at the center of the screen and a "Roll dice" button. The button triggers an animation and generates a random number, which is displayed in the center of the dice when clicked.

This is my first project from [100jsprojetcs](https://www.100jsprojects.com/projects)
